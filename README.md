> This includes the backend server for Open-Certs.

After seeing so many open-source projects being monetized without giving any recognition to contributors, Open-Certs comes with the vision to certify every open-source contribution.

Open-Certs backend is based on RESTFULL arch. as of now. It mainly takes adavntage of `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `ExpressJS`, `EJS` (as tampelate engine), etc. to deliver the required services to [Open-Certs-Frontend](https://github.com/open-certs/oc-frontend)


## Setup

- To get started, install the required node modules:

```
npm install
```
- Then copy the sample.env to .env and configure it.

- Install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## Run
Then issue the following command to run the server:

```
npm start
```

Or use the following command to run the server in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```
